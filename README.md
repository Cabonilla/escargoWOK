# escargoWOK

Full stack Chinese food app using .NET, MSSQL, and Angular 7. 
This was an experimental full stack web application built using the .NET framework and Angular 7 library. It is also my first application not using an online course.
Considering the cleanliness of the code, it was easy to understand what aspects of the overall stack I was modifying. Using TypeScript differentiated from my typical NodeJS workflow.

**Required languages**: HTML, CSS, .NET, MSSQL, JS, Angular 7
